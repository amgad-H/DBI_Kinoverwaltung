## Seats and Movies

Knowing how many empty seats you have and which movie is playing in each room is super important. 
Our system lets you check how many seats are still available in each room and what movie is showing. This helps you plan and make sure your customers have a great time.

## Screen Details

Not all cinema screens are the same. Some are big, some are small, and some show 3D movies. 
Our system tells you all about the screens in each room. So when you're picking movies to show, you'll know which room is the best fit.

## Movie Schedule

Your movie schedule is like the heartbeat of your cinema. 
With our system, you can see all your movie showtimes, titles, and how long each movie lasts. 
This makes it easy to plan what movies to show throughout the day.

## Snack Bar Info

Our system isn't just about rooms; it helps you manage your snack bars too. 
You can find out when they're open, what snacks and drinks they offer, and how much they cost.
